# Clinical Text Analysis for Outcome Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of the research paper "Preserving Knowledge of Long Clinical Texts Using Aggregated Ensembles of Large Language Models" available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01571).

## Abstract

Clinical texts, such as admission notes, discharge summaries, and progress notes, contain rich and valuable information that can be used for various clinical outcome prediction tasks. This project addresses two major challenges in applying large language models to clinical texts: the limitation of input length and the diversity of data sources. We propose a novel method to preserve the knowledge of long clinical texts using aggregated ensembles of large language models.

## Key Features

- Combines ensemble learning with text aggregation
- Trains multiple large language models on two clinical outcome tasks:
  - Mortality prediction
  - Length of stay prediction
- Achieves better results than baselines, ensembling, and aggregation individually
- Improves performance of large language models while handling long inputs and diverse datasets

## Implementation

The project is implemented using:
- PyTorch Framework
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Other associated libraries like NumPy, Pandas.

## Dataset

The experiments are conducted on admission notes from the MIMIC-III clinical database, combining multiple unstructured and high-dimensional datasets.

## Results

Our method demonstrates:
- Effectiveness in handling long clinical texts
- Superiority over existing approaches
- Potential applications in clinical decision-making systems
